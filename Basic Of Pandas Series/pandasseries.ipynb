To install it, just open your terminal and type: `pip install pandas`. Done! And remember, Pandas works beautifully with other tools like NumPy for numerical data, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations. It's widely used in real-world applications—whether you're analyzing stock prices or working on machine learning models.”\n",
